# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project is a machine learning solution aimed at predicting the survival of Titanic passengers. The dataset was processed, cleaned, and analyzed to develop predictive models using various algorithms including **Random Forest Classifier** and **Logistic Regression**.



##  Objective

Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, and more.

---

##  Dataset

The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

### Key Features:
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **Sex**: Gender
- **Age**: Age in years
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings / spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents / children aboard
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Embarked**: Port of Embarkation (C, Q, S)

##  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

---

##  Models Applied

1. **Random Forest Classifier**
2. **Logistic Regression**

Both models were trained and evaluated using standard metrics like **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report**.

--

##  Results

- The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved better performance compared to Logistic Regression.
- Key insights and visualizations were generated using Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand correlations and data distribution.
